# belly-button-challenge
This is my submission for the Module 14 challenge. I have 
- Used the D3 library to read in samples.json
- Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
- Created a gauge chart that shows washing frequency (not quite the same as the example provided - I will attempt to use "pie" instead of "gauge" to get those changes on my own time). 
- Updated all the plots when a new sample is selected.
- Deployed my app to GitHub Pages, which can be found here: https://uzma-azhar.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
